"The viability of life can be measured as the amount of energy used by life in the future to build the infrastructure for itself"

"This energy can be seen as transaction costs"

"thus the viability of life can be measured by the value of the global economy"

Shrinking the state to reverse the programming, make people wake up from their programmed lazinesses, and let people with actual mental issues get seen about and not be used to justify fucked up snowflake policies.

Advocate Private, charter, charity, and religious schools needed to compete with public education.

Make corporations and the state lower the pay wall costs for scientific research online, make donation drives, and with full verified accounts only have to buy the papers once in their lifetimes.

Remove the corporation entity system to make companies use liability levying by contractual law and it need to be shown with logical reasoning and hard proof.

They need to lower the pay wall costs for scientific research online

They need to decentralize the infrastructures to the most used and most important multi-stage production techs we used today such as refrigerators, computers, automation, phones, UVB light bulbs, LED lights, and the electrical grid, then make the THEN decentralized multi-stage production tech down to a heavily dispersed small and medium scale levels so the production can be to the people and actually supplement human labor properly like it's supposed to, that's a start.

It's the same core issues with biofuel making, it's all centralized to a small area where there's THOUSANDS of places where so many feedstocks can can be used and are all trucked far and wide to these few places hence why so much petroleum is put into it, plus it also keeps limits on who can go into the making of the stuff and hurts the working people when it comes to jobs.

Same thing needs to be done with automotive production, tractor computer software designs for agriculture(which should only be used to SUPPLEMENT permaculture), tugboat building, modern industrialized and partially automated metallurgy, ship building, plane building, turbing building, and generator head making, everything else doesn't matter as much, I'm only listing the most used things here, since people value them the most and as such use them the most.

It's the same inefficiency pattern that most of that bad efficiency mess is done on purpose!

Ted Kaczynski recognized there are two kinds of technology:

207. An argument likely to be raised against our proposed
revolution is that it is bound to fail, because (it is
claimed) throughout history technology has always progressed,
never regressed, hence technological regression
is impossible. But this claim is false.
208. We distinguish between two kinds of technology,
which we will call smallscale technology and organizationdependent
technology. Small-scale technology is technology
that can be used by small-scale communities without
outside assistance. Organization-dependent technology
is technology that depends on large-scale social
organization. We are aware of no significant cases of
regression in small-scale technology. But organization dependent
technology DOES regress when the social organization
on which it depends breaks down. Example:
When the Roman Empire fell apart the Romans’ smallscale
technology survived because any clever village
craftsman could build, for instance, a water wheel, any
skilled smith could make steel by Roman methods, and so
forth. But the Romans’ organization- dependent technology
DID regress. Their aqueducts fell into disrepair and
were never rebuilt. Their techniques of road construction
were lost. The Roman system of urban sanitation was forgotten,
so that not until rather recent times did the sanitation
of European cities equal that of Ancient Rome.
209. The reason why technology has seemed always to
progress is that, until perhaps a century or two before the
Industrial Revolution, most technology was small-scale
technology. But most of the technology developed since
the Industrial Revolution is organization-dependent technology.
Take the refrigerator for example.Without factorymade
parts or the facilities of a postindustrial machine
shop it would be virtually impossible for a handful of local craftsmen to build a refrigerator. If by some miracle they
did succeed in building one it would be useless to them
without a reliable source of electric power. So they would
have to dam a stream and build a generator. Generators
require large amounts of copper wire. Imagine trying to
make that wire without modern machinery. And where
would they get a gas suitable for refrigeration? It would
be much easier to build an icehouse or preserve food by
drying or picking, as was done before the invention of the
refrigerator.
210. So it is clear that if the industrial system were once
thoroughly broken down, refrigeration technology would
quickly be lost. The same is true of other organization-dependent
technology. And once this technology had been
lost for a generation or so it would take centuries to rebuild
it, just as it took centuries to build it the first time
around. Surviving technical books would be few and scattered.
An industrial society, if built from scratch without
outside help, can only be built in a series of stages: You
need tools to make tools to make tools to make tools...
A long process of economic development and progress in
social organization is required. And, even in the absence
of an ideology opposed to technology, there is no reason
to believe that anyone would be interested in rebuilding
industrial society. The enthusiasm for “progress” is a phenomenon
peculiar to the modern form of society, and it
seems not to have existed prior to the 17th century or thereabouts.
211. In the late Middle Ages there were four main civilizations
that were about equally “advanced”: Europe,
the Islamic world, India, and the Far East (China, Japan,
Korea). Three of those civilizations remained more or less
stable, and only Europe became dynamic. No one knows
why Europe became dynamic at that time; historians have
their theories but these are only speculation. At any rate,
it is clear that rapid development toward a technological
form of society occurs only under special conditions. So
there is no reason to assume that a long-lasting technological
regression cannot be brought about.
They key here is NOT go full anarcho-primitivism, BUT to look at modern automation, modern industrialized metallurgy, refrigerators, computers, phones, UVB light bulbs, LED lights, biofuel production, automotive production, tractor computer software designs for agriculture(which should only be used to SUPPLEMENT permaculture), tugboat building, ship building, plane building, turbing building, and generator head making, and the electrical grid, then make the THEN decentralized multi-stage production tech down to a heavily dispersed small and medium scale levels so the production can be to the people and actually supplement human labor properly like it's supposed to.

This is the only way that these technologies would not compete against nature, be actually sustainable, and counter-regulate against certain silicon valley corporations that push for fairy-tale chasings like "muh downloadable consciousness" or the delusion of immortality or the singularity hypothesis.

Some aspects of these very ideas or pipedream chasings would be worse than communism or globalized state socialism or global central corporatism

Assuming Moore's observation will hold, of which there have been times of discrepancy for this observation (2011-2017), Elon Musk is right, it would take at least 30 years to hit the singularity
(based on how fast it took for a current supercomputer to simulate a heart now compared to realtime, as of 2020). This speed increase is largely going to be due to adding more cores and since it
is going to be due to adding more cores, we will have to worry about Ahmdahl's law (this time, not an observation). With regards to neural networks, the parallelism would then be a function as
to how wide the neural network is (how many perceptrons exist in any given layer). This is due to the layered structure of a neural network and that every layer has to be executed in serial. The
major limitations to the singularity coming about would be energy and computational density. Addressing energy first, sure, over the past four decades, we have increased computational density
greatly, but at the cost of power. In 2014, released the first consumer octo-core CPU at 140 watts of thermal design power. Today, AMD has octo-cores that it deems to be 65 watts of thermal design
power, but that is due to a quartering of the lithography (14nm linear to 7nm linear). If efficiency increases like this require a quartering of the area of a transistor, we will hit the theoretical
limit of silicon in the next decade with planar lithographies. With new packaging methods such as chiplets and 3D stacked chips, you run into other limits. Chiplets take up larger amounts of area,
chip stacking would then be limited by cooling. So there is computational density as well.

Another limit is the knowledge of the structure of the brain as current "AI" are incapable of abstract thought. Sure, there is WATSON, but the reason why WATSON is so good at Jeopardy is because
he looks at the relationship between words and other words such as the definition of that word or the words in sentences of which that word is used.

With regards to dyson-spheres, the logistics and economics of a dyson sphere would make it such that either it wouldn't  be computing, but creating energy or making it so expensive that it would only
be useful to do either conventional computing tasks or simulation to make a product to make more money.

To touch on ASICs, there are ASICs, however, those ASICs are already "trained" in a sense and therefore, have been locked to a particular set of perceptron weights.
